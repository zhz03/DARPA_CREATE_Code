This folder is a main folder that contains main core codes:

- **simulation.py** : it is to generate all kinds of nd simulated data and it contains simulation related functions 

- **kalman_filter.py** : this is n-d states traditional Kalman filter program
- **planning.py** : this program is to calculate the steady-state Sigma(variance of state $x$ given a long period of time: $t \rightarrow \infty$ ), time step Sigma(variance of state $x$ at one time step $t$), and variance of statistic $U(z)$

- **CompTest_diff_sysM.py** : this program is to test and verify the above programs in n-dimensional space. For more details, please see [PPT](Comprehensive_tests_on_nd_sim_kf_planning.pptx)
